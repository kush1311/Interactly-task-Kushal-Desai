# Candidate Matching System

This project is a candidate matching system that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, Streamlit for the user interface, MySQL for data storage, and NLTK for natural language processing. The system allows users to input a job description and fetch the best-matched candidates from a database based on the job description details.
